      <p>Graduation day for the seniors! An exciting day for all of Makers. So we thought we'd make use of this day; we decided to meet up earlier and crack on with some pair programming.</p>

<p>We met up for 2.30pm and got into our pairs. We used a ruby built software to randomly put us in our pairs. You can find the code for this in my repos.</p>

<p>Pair programming was a fun exercie which was extremely beneficial. I felt that I learnt a lot during this exercise. I learnt of new ways to go about solving a situation and also found out about various tools which make it easier to solve problems. This was a team work exercise which allowed me to learn from my peer and also share my knowledge which they may not have. After a few hours of pair programming, it was time for graduation.</p>

<p>Graduation consisted of 6 presentations which all lasted roughly 5 minutes each. The presentations were amazing. The platforms that each team had built with only 12 weeks of coding were really a true representation of how much one can learn in such a short time. The teams all used various technologies in their projects and were not restricted to just Ruby.</p>

<p>After the graduation we all socialised for a good 2 hours. Everyone was so friendly. It felt as if I knew everyone since ages. A bunch of cool people all under one roof! Before joining Makers I didn't know what to expect; but I'm honestly so happy to be a part of this hard working team. </p>

<p>Everyone went out after but I had to attend a family dinner so couldn't go along with everyone; otherwise I definitely would have! Theres always next time. </p>

<p>So that was graduation day. A great experience. Hopefully many more great experiences to come. Keep an eye out on my blog and follow my journey at Makers Academy.</p>
