      <p>August 3rd was the day I first went in to meet my fellow students at Makers. As I got to the building straight away I met a new student like myself. By the time I was upstairs I had met 3 new people who were ambitious and pumped up ready to learn.</p>

<p>The launch was short but sweet. All the students of the September cohort introduced themselves. Students were from a wide variety of backgrounds; lawyers to a student fresh out of high school. Nikesh continued the evening by introducing us to GitHub, Slack and the Pre-course material. At the end of the short launch; some students went off to the local bar down the road and others headed home.</p>

<p>The excitement has been building for my Makers journey and I hope to share all my experiences with you guys. I hope to learn a lot from this experience and am very determined to make the most of it. Follow my blog to get regular updates on my progress and my makers experience. </p>

<p>Good luck to all my peers.</p>

<p>Usman</p>
