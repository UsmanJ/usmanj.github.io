      <p><b>WOW. Pre-course is over!!</b> </p>

<p>I've learnt a lot during this month. However the last week was hectic. Had to make the most of the last week before becoming a FULL-TIME MAKER! So I went away for three days to Manchester &amp; Sheffield with the family; to meet family. </p>

<p>I didn't forget Ruby whilst I was away though. I started on 'The Well-Grounded Rubyist' by David A. Black. I've got to chapter 5. It's a pretty good read and has many activities to do whilst reading it (doesn't let you get lazy). I also continued with Codewars. I set myself a target of reaching 125 honour. I didn't reach that target. I did however get up to 104. Main reason being that I was away and I was also doing exercises from the textbook. </p>

<p>Slack's been quiet over the weekend (Messenger that Makers use). I'm assuming everyones relaxing a little before we start in full force tomorrow. Well I'm off too; need to catch a good nights sleep tonight ready for our first full day. Very excited! </p>

<p>I'll update you guys on more during the week :)</p>
