      <p>So week 1 flew by. Our pre-course week 1 was based on command-line. I had not ever studied command-line prior to this. I studied the online material which was posted on the pre-course website followed by trying out the practise exercises. I was surprised by how quickly I picked things up. The few things that I struggled with were solved quickly by the support of my peers via the slack app.</p>

<p>I began on the weekly test on the Friday and it didn't take too long to complete (but took longer than the 1 hours target stated in the test description). The instructions were really straight forward and some material required you to conduct your own research (google). I learnt a lot from this exercise and I'm sure next week I will learn even more!</p>

<p>This week I did not use the git issues page which I will try to make use of next week. However I have been using Slack to communicate with my peers which has proved to be very beneficial.</p>
