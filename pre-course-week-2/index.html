      <p>This weeks task involved getting use to version control (git). I had used git previously on one occasion, but I ended up deleting everything from the git and loosing all my work. This time round I managed to keep all my work safe.</p>

<p>We were advised to go over the exercises on <a href="http://gitimmersion.com">Git Immersion</a>. This was very hands on and increased my understanding of git immensely. However I did struggle to understand the variation between merging and rebasing.</p>

<p>This week I also deployed my Ghost blog on GitHub. This was made easy due to my understanding of Git and GitHub. Having spoken to some of my peers on Slack, I gathered that many people were struggling to deploy their blogs onto GitHub. Due to this I created a 'How to' blog on how to create a Ghost blog locally and then deploy it onto GitHub. This can be found <a href="http://usmanj.github.io/setting-up-a-ghost-blog-on-github/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Overall the experience has been very hands on and I have learnt a lot about using git/GitHub. I have also developed further my command line skills from the previous week by using command line constantly during the course of the week.</p>

<p>I managed to finish all the version control work early and was pretty confident with it so I went on and started going over <a href="https://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/chap_00.html">Chris Pine's exercises</a>. I had done this prior to my Maker's interview but decided to go over it again to jog my memory.</p>

<p>That's it for this week. </p>

<p>Follow my blog for more updates during the next week and many more weeks to come.</p>
