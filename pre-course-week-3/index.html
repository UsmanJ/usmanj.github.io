      <p><b>It's been a crazy week! Chris Pine tried to take over my life. But I dumped him for Ruby Kickstart.</b> </p>

<p>As we were told at the pre-course launch, after week 2 things were going to get real hard. And they were. Ruby literally took over my life. The torture of being so close to solving a challenge yet being so far. My head started to hurt by the end of the week. But theres no giving up! In fact it feels like a game, its so addictive. You don't even feel like your working/studying. It's just so fun. My peers are all so much fun too. The environment is so cool! I'm loving it!</p>

<p>Anyway so I managed to complete Ruby Kickstarter (going to try and complete Chris Pine this week) and I've managed to get <b>70</b> points on codewars. I'm going to try and get 125 by the end of the week (fingers crossed). </p>

<p>I've had a long week so I'm going to hit the bed. Need to be up early tomorrow for some more Ruby! See what I mean, its addictive!</p>

<p>Adios for now. </p>
